# OpenSource_Project_Guidelines
This repository is to help me with creating repositories that can be used for Open Source Projects.

I have come to realise that the things that i have to remember in order to make a good open source project is not something that I can always remember.
So, I have come up with this repository that will contain information about the workflow that can be used to create a project repository.

Workflow.
- Create a new Private Repository from this template repository.
- Check each box until all the following files are changed with the right project name.
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- [ ] README.md
- [ ] LICENSE.md
- The LICENSE by default would be GPL3 if needed can be changed according to use.
- The repository is initialised.
- Change the visibility to Public(If its time to make it public).
- The Open Source Project is Initialised.
