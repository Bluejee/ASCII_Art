# ASCII Art

This project is an ASCII Art Generator created using p5.js. It converts images into ASCII art by mapping grayscale values to ASCII characters.

## Features

2. Upload an image using the file input.
3. The ASCII art representation of the image will be displayed on the screen.

### Requirements

## Inspiration
The ASCII Art Generator project is inspired by the pioneering work of Daniel Shiffman in the realm of p5.js. Daniel Shiffman, known for his educational content on the "The Coding Train" YouTube channel, has been a significant influence in this project's development. For those interested in creating their own versions or learning more about p5.js, I highly recommend visiting his YouTube channel at [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) and his website at [The Coding Train Website](https://thecodingtrain.com/). His resources are invaluable for anyone looking to delve deeper into creative coding and interactive applications.
